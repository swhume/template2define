# template2define2-1

## Introduction
The template2define2-1 program takes the Define-Template.json generated by Define-Template.py available in
[Pierre Dostie's 360i repo](https://github.com/dostiep/360i) and generates a Define-XML v2.1 file.
Template2define2-1 uses odmlib to generate the Define-XML output.

Both this application and Define-Template.py are CLI applications and can be run in sequence to produce a Define-XML 
v2.1 file. Once generated, the Define-XML file can be validated and rendered as HTML using the Define-XML style sheet.

Template2define2-1.py and Define-Template.py are written in Python and are under active development. They are not 
complete and more features will be added in the near future.

## Getting Started
To run template2define.py from the command-line: 

```aiignore
python template2define2-1.py -t ./data/Define-Template.json -d ./data/define-360i.xml
```

The odmlib package must be installed to run xlsx2define2-1. See the 
[odmlib repository](https://github.com/swhume/odmlib) to install the odmlib source code and latest features. 
The odmlib package can also be installed from PyPi with the understanding that it is still in development 
so might not have everything available in the odmlib repository. It can be installed from PyPi using:

```aiignore
pip install odmlib
```

## Limitations
Template2define2-1.py is still under development.
